In this project, I implemented the MERN stack with Tailwind CSS for styling. The project functions flawlessly by allowing users to register with specified roles and authenticate during login. The server effectively manages user sessions to track website visits and restrict access to routes without prior login. Three distinct roles - manager, HR, and receptionist - grant access to specific pages, while preventing unauthorized access to others.
