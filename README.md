In this project, I implemented the MERN stack with Tailwind CSS for styling. The project functions seamlessly, enabling users to register with specific roles and authenticate during login. The server efficiently manages user sessions to monitor website visits and restrict access to routes without prior login.
The system supports three distinct roles—manager, HR, and receptionist—each granting access to specific pages while preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, the robust session management ensures users can only access pages after logging in, thereby maintaining security and integrity.
